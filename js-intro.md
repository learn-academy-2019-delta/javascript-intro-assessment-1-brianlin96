# ASSESSMENT 1: INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT
## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: Object that is used to complete some sort of action 

  Researched answer: A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.


2. What is a method?

  Your answer: function that acts on an object 

  Researched answer: JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects.


3. List 5 examples of JavaScript string methods.

  Your answer: str.length() , str.indexOf(), str.split(""), str.charAt(1), str.toUpperCase

  Researched answer: str.charAt(), str.repeat(), str.replace(), str.search(), str.slice()


4. List 5 examples of JavaScript array methods.

  Your answer: arr.length, arr.pop, arr1.concat(arr2), arr.concat, arr.push()

  Researched answer: arr.shift(), arr.unshift("str"), arr.map(function()), arr.reverse(), arr.splice()


5. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Provide an example of each.

  Your answer: accessor gets information from an array without changing it. The mutators act on the arrays and will modify them. Accessor: arr.join(""). Mutator: arr.push("hi")

  Researched answer: Methods that modify the original array are known as mutator methods, and methods that return a new value or representation are known as accessor methods. Accessor: arr.indexOf(5). Mutator. arr.reverse()


6. Explain the difference between console.log() and return.

  Your answer: console.log() prints out whatever is within the parentheses onto the console. Return will return a value to the function or method that can be accessed by other functions/methods

  Researched answer: The Console method log() outputs a message to the web console. The return statement ends function execution and specifies a value to be returned to the function caller.


7. In regards to functions, what is an argument? What is the difference between an argument and a variable?

  Your answer: An argument is the variable that the function is going to be acting on. A variable is something that hold information

  Researched answer: Arguments are values passed to the function when it is invoked. JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.


8. Give a brief description of JavaScript as if you were explaining it to someone who doesn't know anything about programming.

  Your answer: Object-oriented langauge that is used for front-end development

  Researched answer: JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted scripting language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions


9. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the rolls of each person?

  Your answer: In pair programming, there is a driver and a navigator. The driver is the one that is writing out the code while the navigator is the one helping to direct through looking for errors, and helping think through the logic 

  Researched answer: Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.
